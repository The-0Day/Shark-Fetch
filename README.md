![](Images/greyshark-slackware.png )<br/><br/>
This Script Can Loads ASCII Art as Themes, It Has 3 Default Themes but You Can Use Your Custom Themes Too.<br/>
You Can Use [This Project](https://github.com/TheZoraiz/ascii-image-converter) to Make ASCII Arts.
Recommended Size For Your ASCII Art is 40x20


For Loading Your Theme Just Once:<br/>\
(In Directory which Your Theme Located Too (example.txt))
  ```sharkfetch -t example.txt```

But You Can Import Your Theme in Configuration Directory and Use it Several Times: <br/>
First of All Put Your Theme File in ```~/.config/SharkFetch/themes/```<br/>
its Better to Remove .txt Extension From The File, Then<br/>
  ```sharkfetch -t example```<br>
      it will use ~/.config/SharkFetch/themes/example theme

<br/>Tip: You Can Findout Available Themes With ```--list``` or ```-l``` Switch.<br/>
Note: If You Made an Awesome Theme which You Think Maybe Someone Likes too, Feel Free to PR it On ```Users_Themes``` Directory of Main Repo.

### Known Issues
#### Icons Issue
If Your Terminal Doesnt Show Icons Well, You Have to Install a Nerd Font.<br/>
##### Install Our Recommended Font:
After clone this repo, copy all fonts to ```.fonts```

### Bonus Tip
Enter ```sharkfetch -t wood``` and You Will See The Big Wood Guy :D
